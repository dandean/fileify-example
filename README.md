Example node-fileify application
================================

This differs from the example on the node-fileify page in that it does not
include jQuery, so client-side script is cut down to ~300 LOC from ~9,000 LOC.

Run it!
-------

``` sh
git clone git://github.com/dandean/fileify-example.git
cd fileify-example
npm install
node server.js
```

Point a browser at http://localhost:8080
